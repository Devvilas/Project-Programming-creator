# Project Programming creator
 
# How it works?
Basically, at startup it will start at the command prompt, then it will ask for "Project name" where, you will enter your project name, after that it will ask for the path where you want to save the project, if you don't know how to find the path do the following steps:
1. Open file explorer
2. Open in the location where you want to save the project
3. at the top in the view of folders, files, etc... A bar will appear, click on that bar and it will appear for example "C:/Users/exemple/desktop", that is the path and that's what we want for that copy this and back to the command prompt, paste the path into the question

And then you have how to find the path
then a lot of things will appear:
    File types
1. Python
2. JS
3. Cmd
4. Bat
5. txt
6. HTML
7. css

These are the types of programming files, with the exception of 5 which is txt, which is normal text.

That's why I want my project to have a JavaScript file, so I'm going to write the number "2"

After that the program closes by itself, and if you executed all the steps correctly, in the location that is the path you chose there must be a folder with the name of the project you chose there and inside the folder the file you chose should

And then inside the file will be the following written "#Created successfully", that you can delete
